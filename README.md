## Contributing

Bug reports are welcome on GitHub at https://github.com/gunbolt/pikoin. This project is intended to be a safe, welcoming space for collaboration, and contributors are expected to adhere to the [code of conduct](https://github.com/gunbolt/pikoin/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

Please always open a new issue before sending a pull request if you want to add a new feature to pikoin, unless it is a minor fix, and wait until someone from the core team approves it before you actually start working on it. Otherwise, you risk having the pull request rejected, and the effort implementing it goes to waste. And if you start working on an implementation for an issue, please let everyone know in the comments so someone else does not start working on the same thing.
